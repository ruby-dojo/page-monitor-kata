# A Page Monitor

A ruby gem that monitors a web page for changes. Whenever the content changes, the gem notifies the user by email.

<!--

Have ready:

- a rails app to test stuff
- a mailer using Mail and a group gmail account for credentials
- a gem skeleton

-->

## Feature #1
    
- Given we are just getting started
- When the user calls the command line app passing in a URL in option
- Then the app fetches the web page at the URL and saves it to disk

## Feature #2

- Given the app has already saved a previous state for the specified URL
- When the user calls the app again with the same URL
- Then the app fetches the web page and diffs the current content with the content saved to disk

## Feature #3

- Given writers make typos
- When a typo is corrected on the page
- Then the app should not flag a change

<note>
You could also make sure you don't flag a change when the nonce of a form changed.
</note>

## Feature #4

- Given the content of the `head` tag is not interesting to me
- When the content of the `head` tag changes
- Then the app should not flag a change

## Feature #5
    
- Given the app knows how to detect changes
- When the contents of a web page has changed
- Then I should receive an email detailing the changes

## Feature #6

- Given the app is ready to ship
- When I install the gem
- Then I am able to use it by running the executable on the path
