# The Page Monitor Kata

This is a kata where the goal is to build a ruby gem that monitors a web page for changes. Whenever the content changes, the gem notifies the user by email.

Have a look [over there](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo) for more information on dojos and katas. See the kata specifications below.

# Feature #1
- Given we are just getting started
- When I compare two pieces of text
- Then I know whether or not they are the same

A simple function that takes in two strings and returns true or false will do.

# Feature #2
    
- Given we are just getting started
- When the user calls the command line app passing in a URL in option
- Then the app fetches the web page at the URL and saves it to disk

You can require `open-uri` and use the global function `open` to fetch the URL.

# Feature #3

- Given the app has already saved a previous state for the specified URL
- When the user calls the app again with the same URL
- Then the app fetches the web page and compares the current content with the content saved to disk

Return true if the content is the same, or false if it changed.

# Feature #4

- Given writers make typos
- When a typo is corrected on the page
- Then the app should not flag a change

You could also make sure you don't flag a change when only the authenticity token of a form changed.

# Feature #5

- Given the content of the `head` tag is not interesting to me
- When only the content of the `head` tag changes
- Then the app should not flag a change

You could support a list of uninteresting tags (e.g. `input`, `button`, `form`)

# Feature #6
    
- Given the app knows how to detect changes
- When the contents of a web page has changed
- Then I should receive an email detailing the changes

# Feature #7

- Given the app is ready to ship
- When I install the gem
- Then I am able to use it by running the executable on the path
